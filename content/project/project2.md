The P4 fellow who works on this project will analyze key performance indicators, data on environmental conditions in swine barns, and statistics on pre-weaning mortality across six hog farms spread throughout the SE U.S. The goal of the project will be to identify correlations between environmental and performance factors and hog mortality in order to provide data-driven improvements to swine farm management. The student who works on this project will regularly interact with a producer and engage in Extension. This project addresses the Grand Challenges Facing Animal Production of (1) optimizing the health and productivity of animals in a manner that protects and enhances human health, (2) producing animal proteins in an economically, environmentally and socially acceptable manner that meets the demands of an increasing population, and (3) optimizing animal well-being in a socially acceptable and sustainable manner.
