The P4 fellow who works on this project will analyze digitized USDA Census of Agriculture records from post-WWII to the present day to identify long-term trends of animal agriculture in leading production counties in terms of farm sizes and proximity to crop production. The fellow will also utilize machine learning techniques to analyze countiesâ€™ agricultural production over time to identify common trends in animal agriculture changes over the past century and key variables that can be used to predict future trends, insight on which will inform strategic planning related to animal agriculture. This project addresses the Grand Challenges Facing Animal Production of (1) producing animal proteins in an economically, environmentally and socially acceptable manner that meets the demands of an increasing population, and (2) optimizing and ensuring responsible and sustainable use of water.
