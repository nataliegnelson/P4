The P4 fellow who works on this project will analyze long-term data on swine waste chemistry and management to identify existing trends with swine waste composition and ammonium deposition on the surrounding landscape. The overall goal of this project will be to produce data-driven insight on how swine waste management can be enhanced to mitigate environmental impacts. This project addresses the Grand Challenges Facing Animal Production of (1) producing animal proteins in an economically, environmentally and socially acceptable manner that meets the demands of an increasing population, and (2) optimizing and ensuring responsible and sustainable use of water.
