The P4 fellow who works on this project will analyze data collected from a range of different swine and poultry barns in China, and perform a comparative analysis to identify areas in which domestic and Chinese systems diverge. The P4 fellow will work closely with our Chinese collaborators at Zhejiang University. This project addresses the Grand Challenges Facing Animal Production of (1) producing animal proteins in an economically, environmentally and socially acceptable manner that meets the demands of an increasing population, and (2) optimizing and ensuring responsible and sustainable use of water.
