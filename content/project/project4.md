The P4 fellow who works on this project will learn bioinformatics tools and statistics used to identify and characterize genes important in  heat shock/heat stress  response of poultry and pigs. This project addresses the Grand Challenges Facing Animal Production of (1) optimizing the health and productivity of animals in a manner that protects and enhances human health, (2) producing animal proteins in an economically, environmentally and socially acceptable manner that meets the demands of an increasing population, and (3) optimizing animal well-being in a socially acceptable and sustainable manner.
