*Pigs, Poultry, the Planet and Data-Driven Problem-Solving* (nicknamed "P4") is a USDA NIFA-funded Research and Extension Experience for Undergraduates summer fellowship program. The P4 program is designed to develop the **next generation of data-savvy food animal production professionals, extension associates, and researchers**. P4 fellows learn how to apply data-driven analytics and problem-solving to address issues surrounding global intensification of poultry and swine production. The program takes place at North Carolina State University in Raleigh, NC, in partnership with North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University.  

P4 fellows will:  

* **Gain skills** in data science, data-driven problem solving, holistic evaluation of food animal production systems, global thinking, and technical communications  
* Work on a **data-driven research project** under the supervision of two faculty mentors
* Visit poultry and swine production facilities in North Carolina to gain **hands-on experience**
* **Participate in a weeklong workshop in China** (expenses paid) involving knowledge and cultural exchange with scholars at two universities to learn about international food animal production systems  
* Network with **industry professionals** in the food animal production and data analytics industries
* Receive a **stipend**, on-campus housing, and meal allowance
