*Pigs, Poultry, the Planet and Data-Driven Problem-Solving* (nicknamed "P4") is a USDA NIFA-funded Research and Extension Experience for Undergraduates summer fellowship program. The P4 program is designed to develop the next generation of data-savvy food animal production professionals, extension associates, and researchers. P4 fellows learn how to apply data-driven analytics and problem-solving to address issues surrounding global intensification of poultry and swine production. The program is led by North Carolina State University in partnership with North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University. **In 2021, the P4 program will be virtual, with participants working from their home locations.** We anticipate admitting 8 students in the 2021 cohort. We are tentatively planning a one-week in-person orientation in which the students will visit animal production facilities and meet their peers and mentors.

P4 fellows will:  

* **Gain skills** in data science, data-driven problem solving, holistic evaluation of food animal production systems, global thinking, and technical communications  
* Work on a **data-driven research project** under the supervision of two faculty mentors
* Visit poultry and swine production facilities in North Carolina to gain **hands-on experience** during a one-week in-person orientation (Note: these experiences are tentatively scheduled during a one-week in-person orientation; strict coronavirus transmission risk mitigation measures will be implemented.)
* Network with **industry professionals** in the food animal production and data analytics industries
* Receive a $5,500 **stipend**  

The P4 program is dedicated to the goal of supporting the development of a culturally diverse workforce, and strongly encourages applications from women, racial and ethnic minorities, individuals with disabilities, first generation college students, and veterans.
