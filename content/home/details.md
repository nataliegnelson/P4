**Eligibility:** Enrolled undergraduate students of sophomore or junior standing are eligible to apply. Only U.S. citizens are eligible to receive funding, but self-funded non-U.S. citizens are welcome to apply. Interests in food animal production and data science are required; prior experience is not. Some background in statistics (e.g. completion of an introductory statistics course) is preferred, but not required. Students who do not have current passports will be expected to apply for one immediately after receiving notice of acceptance into the program.

**Schedule:** The program spans 11 weeks and begins the week after Memorial Day. In 2019, the program will occur from May 28 - August 11; the trip to China takes place during the final two weeks of the program. 

**Compensation:** Fellows will receive a $5,280 stipend, $100/week meal allowance ($1,100 total), on-campus housing, travel to China, and financial support to attend a national conference. Financial assistance to support travel to/from home institutions to NC State is available.

**Housing:** Fellows will stay in the Wolf Village Apartments on NC State's campus in Raleigh, NC. Each fellow will have his or her own room and shared bathrooms. Fellows will have access to on-campus facilities and resources including the Wolfline Bus system.
