**Eligibility:** Enrolled undergraduate students of sophomore or junior standing who are interested in food animal production and data science are eligible to apply. **Students who will have graduated by May 2020 are not eligible to participate.** Only U.S. citizens are eligible to receive funding. 

**Statistics prerequisites:** Prior background in statistics (e.g. completion of an introductory statistics course) is required. Applicants should have understanding of the following statistical concepts prior to starting the program: random variables, probability distributions, hypothesis testing, and regression. If you need a refresher on these topics, please refer to [OpenIntro Statistics](https://leanpub.com/openintro-statistics). 

**Schedule:** The program spans 11 weeks and begins the week after Memorial Day. In 2020, the program will occur from May 28 - August 7; the workshop in China takes place during the third week of the program. 

**Passport:** Students who do not have current passports will be expected to apply for one immediately after receiving notice of acceptance into the program. The program will not cover costs associated with securing a passport. There will be sufficient time from notification of acceptance to apply for a passport prior to departing for China.

**Compensation:** Fellows will receive a $4,500 stipend, on-campus housing, and travel to China. Financial assistance to support travel to/from home institutions to NC State may be available.

**Housing:** Fellows will stay in the Wolf Village Apartments on NC State's campus in Raleigh, NC. Each fellow will have his or her own room and shared bathrooms. Fellows will have access to on-campus facilities and resources including the Wolfline Bus system.
